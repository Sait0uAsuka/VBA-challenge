Module 2 Challenge - EXCEL and VBA Scripting


Under this Module, you will have to use VBA script to figure out following the thing:


1) The ticker symbol 
	(as you can see in excel, there is a lot of AAF, make it only one AAF and the only one next ticker and so on)


2) Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
   	(formula = open price (AAF, first date) - Close price (AAF, not the same date) = value (under the same Q1))



3) The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
	(formula = (percent Change = ((close price - open price) / open price)) * 100))


4) The total stock volume of the stock. 
	(this is a sum of all the total stock in the Q1 under the same ticker name AAF for example)



5) Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
	(this is a script to show max and min of percent change, also the mas of total volume into a new cells place WITH corresponding ticker name)
